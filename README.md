## Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Rollout and Policy Iteration


Implementation of the Multiagent Rollout
based on the 
paper by Dimitri Bertsekas (2021).
Original contribution from https://github.com/cor3bit.
Made necessary changes to be compatible with dependencies related to Apple M1 processors.

### Environment

Simulation environment follows the rules of the Spiders-and-Flies game as 
specified in [1]. The environment is adapted from Anurag Koul's ma-gym [2] 
modifying the PredatorPrey env. Necessary changes have been made to export and view the observations when render dependencies are high.
